Gameplay:

Story:

Player, a new student in a school for burgeoning adventurers begins his first day of class. Instruction at this school is different: all education revolves around practical experience. Each of Player's professors give him assignments relating to their area of study‒be it potion making, archery, or fauna studies‒which require exploring the school's local caves and returning safely having fulfilled the professor's request. A dark secret becomes slowly apparent, though, that few students survive their time at the school, and that the professors only give assignments as petty errand running and for tasks they fear too dangerous for themselves. In the course of discovering this, Player subsequently fights (and kills) each of his professors after completing all of their (partially-random quests). Having killed all of the professors, the Player must traverse the most dangerous of dungeons yet to discover a key to the headmaster's office. There, he kills the headmaster and assumes position as leader of the school.
